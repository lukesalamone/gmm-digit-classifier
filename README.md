# GMM Digit Classifier
This repository contains experiments which cluster the MNIST dataset.

1. K-means classifier
2. Gaussian Mixture Model classifier

## Generative model
GMMs can also generate new images. We use models with varying numbers of components and generate new images using the `sample()` function.
